Compilation:
This program was compiled on gl15 using C++11, QT 5.1, and OpenGL 3.3.

Running:
To run this program, use the following command. If the path to a puppet is not specified, the program will look for puppet.lua in the current directory. If the specified puppet doesn't exist, it'll likely crash.
$ ./puppeteer [path/to/puppet]

Assumptions:
-That requirements listed in the compilation section exist on the target computer
-Shaders are located in either the current directory, shaders/, or src/shaders/
-The puppet exists and is valid
